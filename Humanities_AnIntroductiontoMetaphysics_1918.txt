T

HIS

celebrated essay

was

first

pub­

lished in the Revue de M ctaphysique

et de Morale, in January, 1903.

It ap­

peared then after Time and Ji'ree Will and
Matter and Memory and before Creative
Evolution j and while containing ideas set

forth in the first two of these works, it
announces some of those which were after­
wards developed in the last.
Though this book can in no sense be
regarded as an epitome of the others, it
yet forms the best introduction to them.
M. Edouard Le Roy in his lately published
book on M. Bergson's philosophy speaks

of

" this marvelously suggestive study which
<'onstitutes the best preface to the books

themselves."
It has, however, more importance than a
flimple introduction would have, for in it

l\1. Bergson explains, at greater length and
in greater detail than in the other

exactly what be means to convey by the
word intuition.

The intuitive method is

treated independently and not, as elsewhere
in his writings, incidentally, in its appli­
cations to particular problems.

For this

reason every writer who bas attempted to
give a complete exposition of M. Bergson's
philosophy has been obliged to quote this

eRsay at length ; and it is indispensable
therefore to the full understanding of its
author's position.

Translations into Ger­

man, Italian, Hungarian, Polish, Swedish,
and Russian have lately appeared, but the

l"rP.nch original is at present out of print.
This translation bas had the great ad­
vantage of being revised in proof by the
author.

I have to thank him for many

alternative renderings, and also for a few
slight alterations

in t he text, which he

thought would make his meaning clearer.

An Introduction to
Metaphysics

A

COMPARISON of the definitions of
metaphysics and the various concep-

tions of the absolute leads to the discovery
that philosophers, in spite of their apparent
divergencies, agree in distinguishing two
profoundly different ways of knowing a
thing.

The

first

implies

that

we

move

round the object; the second that we enter
into it.

The first depends on the point of

view at which we are placed and on the
symbols by which we express ourselves.
The second neither depends on a point of
view nor relies on any symbol.

The first

kind of knowledge may be said to stop at
the

relative;

the

second,

in

those cases

where it is possible, to attain the
I

absolute.

An Introduction to

Consider, for example, the movement of
an object in space.

i

l\Iy perception of the

motion will vary w th the point of view,
moving or stationary, from which I observe
i t.

�I�· expression of it will v ary with the

systems of axes, or the points of reference,
to wh ich I relate it; that i s, with the sym­
bols

which

it.

For this

reason I call such motion relative:

in the one l'al'le, as in the othe r, I am placed

nnt!oliclP thc• ohjPct itself.

R ut when I speak

of an absolute movement, I am attributing

to tbt> mewing object an interior and, so to
Rpeak, stateR of mind; I also imply that I

am in sympathy with those states, and that
I inRt>rt myRelf in them by an effort of
imagination.

ject

Then,

according as the ob­

iH moving or s tationary, according as

it adopts one movement or another, what
I experience will vary.

And what I ex­

neither on the point
of viPw I may take up in regard to the

late the motion, since I have rejected all
translations in order to possess the original.
In short, I shall no longer grasp the move­
ment from without, remaining where I am,
but from where it is, from within, as it is
in itself.

I shall possess an absolute.

Consider, again, a character whose ad­
ventures are related to me in a novel.

The

author may multiply the traits of his hero's
character, may make him speak and act as
much as he pleases, but all this can never
be equivalent to the simple and indivisible
feeling which I should experience if I were
able for an instant to identify my�elf with
the person of the hero himself.

Out of that

indivisible feeling, as from a spring, all the
words, gestures, and actions of the man

the person himself would alone give me
the absolute.
It is in this sense, and in this sense only,
that absolute is synonymous with perfec­

tion.

Were all the photographs of a town,

taken from all possible points of view, to
go on indefinitely completing one another,
they would never be equivalent to the solid
town in which we walk about.

Were all

the translations of a poem into all possible
languages to add together their various
shades of meaning and, correcting each
other by a kind of mutual retouching, to
give a more and more faithful image of
the poem they translate, they would yet
never succeed in rendering the inner mean­
ing of the original.

A representation taken

from a certain point of view, a translation
made with certain symbols, will always
remain imperfect in comparison with the
object of which a view has been taken, or,
which the symbols seek to express.

But the

absolute, which is the object and not its
representation, the original and not its

An Introduction to

translation, is perfect, by being perfectly
what it is.
It is doubtless for this reason that the

absolute has often been identified with the
infinite.

Suppose that I wished to com­

municate to some one who did not know
Greek the extraordinarily simple impres­
sion that a passage in Homer makes upon
me; I should first give a translation of the
lines, I should then comment on my trans­
lation, and then develop the commentary;
in this way, by piling up explanation on
explanation, I might approach nearer and
nearer to what I wanted to express; but I
should never quite reach it.

When you

raise your arm, you accomplish a movement
of which you have, from within, a simple
perception; but for me, watching it from
the outside, your arm passes through one
point, then through another, and between
these two there will be still other points;
so that, iC I began to count, the operation
would go on for ever.

Viewed from the

inside, then, an absolute is a simple thing;

but looked at from the outside, that is to
say, relatively to other things, it becomes,
in relation to these signs which express it,
the gold coin for which we never seem able
to finish giving small change.

Now, that

which lends itself at the same time both
to an indivisible apprehension and to an
inexhaustible enumeration is, by the very
definition of the word, an infinite.
It follows from this that an absolute
could only be given in an intuition, whilst
everything else falls within the province of

analysis.

By intuition is meant the kind

of ·intellectual sympathy by which

one

places oneself within an object in order to
coincide with what is unique in it and con­
sequently inexpressible.

Analysis, on the

contrary, is the operation which reduces the
object to elements already known, that is,
to elements common both to it •and other
objects.

To analyze, therefore, is to ex­

press a thing as a function of something
other than itself.

All analysis is thus a

translation, a development into symbols, a

Positive science works, then, above all, with
symbols.

Even the most. conerde of t h e

natural sciences, those concerned with life,
confine themselves to the visible form of
living beings, their organs and anatomita I
elements.

They make comparisons between

these forms, they reduce the more complex

Metaphysics
to the more simple; in short, they study
the workings of life in what is, so to speak,
only its visual symbol. If there exists any
means of possessing a reality absolutely in­
stead of knowing it relatively, of placing
oneself within it instead of looking at it
from outside pofnts of view, of having the
intuition instead of making the analysis :

is

There is, beneath these sharply cut crys­
tals and this frozen surface, a continuous
flux which is not comparable to any flux I
have ever seen. There is a succession of
states, each of which announces that which
follows and contains that which precedes
it. They can, properly speaking, only be
said to form multiple states when I have
already passed them and turn back to ob­
serve their track. Whilst I was experien­
cing them they were so solidly organized, so
profoundly animated with a common life,
that I could not have said where any one
of them finished or where another com­
menced. In reality no one of them begins
or ends, but all extend into each other.
This inner life may be compared to the
unrolling of a coil, for there is no living

Let us bear

in mind that this action, in spite of its
duration, is indivisible if accomplished with­
out stopping, that if a stopping-point is in­
serted, we have two actions instead of one,
that each of these separate actions is then
the indivisible operation of which we speak,
and that it is not the moving action itself
which is divisible, but, rather, the Rtation­
ary line it leaves behind it as its track in
space.

Finally, let us free ourselves from

the space which underlies the movement in
order to consider only the movement itself,
the act of tension or extension; in short,
pure mobility.

We shall have this time a

more faithful image of the. development of
our self in duration.

But it is even less possible to represent

danger.

Just in so far as abstract ideas can render
service to analysis, that is, to the scientific
study of the object in its relations to other
objects, so far are they incapable of replac­
ing intuition, that is, the metaphysical in­
vestigation of what is essential and unique
in the object.

For on the one hand these

concepts, laid side by side, never actua1ly
give us more than an artificial reconstruc­
tion of the object, of which they can only
symbolize certain general, and, in a way ,
impersonal aspects; it is therefore useless
to believe that with them we can seize a
reality of which they present to us the

Extracted from the metaphysical

object, and presented in a concept, it grows
indefinitely larger,

and

goes beyond the

object i tself, since henceforth it has to con­
tain it, along with a number of other objects.
Thus the different concepts that we form of
the properties of a thing inscribe round it
1:10 many circles, each much too large and

none of them fitting it exactly.

And yet,

in the thing itself the properties coincided
with the thing, and coincided consequently
with one another.

venience of dividing the concrete unity of
the object into so many symbolical expres­
sions; they also divide philosophy into dis­
tinct schools, each of which takes its seat,
chooses its counters, and carries on with
the others a game that will never end.
Either metaphysics is only this play of
ideas, or else, if i� is a serious occupation
of the mind, if it is a science and not simply
an exercise, it must transcend concepts in
order to reach intuition.
Certainly, conJ
-/
cepts are necessary to it, ·for all the other
sciences work as a rule with concepts, and
metaphysics cannot dispense with the other
sciences. But it is only truly itself when
it goes beyond the concept, or at least when
it frees itself from rigid and ready-made
concepts in order to create a kind very dif­
ferent from those which we habitually use;
I mean supple, mobile, and almost fluid
representations, always ready to mould
themselves on the fleeting forms of intui­
tion. We shall return later to this import­

Let us try for an instant to consider our
duration as a multiplicity.

It will then be

necessary to add that the terms of this
multiplicity, instead of �eing distinct, as
they are in any other multiplicity, encroach
on one another; and that while we can no
doubt, by an effort of imagination, solidify
dm-ation once it has elapsed, divide it into
juxtaposed portions and count all these
portions, yet this operation is accomplished
on the frozen memory of the duration, on
the stationary trace which the mobility of
duration leaves behind it, and not on the
duration itself.

We must admit, therefore,

that if there is a multiplicity here, it bears
no resemblance to any other multiplicity
we know.

Shall we say, then, that dura·

Metaphysics
tion has unity?

23

Doubtless, a continuity of

elements which prolong themselves into one
another participates in unity as much as
in multiplicity; but this moving, changing,
colored, living unity has hardly anything
in common with the abstract, motionless,
and empty unity which the concept of pure
unity

circumscribes.

Shall

we

conclude

from this that duration must be defined as
unity and multiplicity at the same time?

but the artist does not concern himself with
these stones, he notes only the silhouette of
the tower.

For the real and internal organi­

zation of the thing he substitutes, then, an
external and schematic representation.

So

that, on the whole, his sketch corresponds
to an observation of the object from a cer·
tain point of view and to the choice of a
certain means of representation.

But ex­

actly the same thing holds true of the
operation by which the psychologist ex­
tracts a single mental state from the whole
personality.

This isolated psychical state

is hardly anything but a sketch, the com­

It soon comes to believe

that by putting together all these diagrams
it can reconstitute the object itself.

No

wonder, then, that it sees this object fly be·
fore it, like a child that would like to make
a solid pla�'thing out of the shadows out·
lined along the wall!
But rationalism is the dupe of the same
illusion.

It starts out from the same con·

fusion as empiricism, and remains equally
powerless to rPach the inner splf.

Like

empiricism, it considers psychical states as
so many fragments detached from an ego
that hinds them together.

Like empiricism,

it tries to join these fragments together· in
order to re-create the unity of the self.
!.ike empiricism, finally, it sees this unity
of the self, in the continually renewed effort

it makes to clasp it, steal away indefinitely
like a phantom.

But whilst empiricism,

weary of the struggle, ends by declarin�
that there is nothing else but the multi·
plieity of ps)·chical states, rationalism per·
sists in affirming the 'tinity of the person;

An Introduction to

34

It is true that, seeking this unity on the
level of the psychical states themselves, and
obliged, besides, to put down to the account
of these states all the qualities and deter­
minations that it finds by analysis (since
analysis by its very definition leads always
to states), nothing is left to it, for the unity
of personality, but something purely nega­
tive, the absence of all determination.

The

psychical states having necessarily in this
analysis

these shadows o f the ego, t h e sum of which
was for the empiricists the equivalent of
the self, rationalism, in order to reconstitute
personality, adds something still more un­
real, the void in which these shadows move
-a place for shadows, one might say.

How

could this " form," which is,..iif truth form­
less, serve to characterize a living, active,

Metaphysics

35

concrete personality, or to distinguish Peter
from

Paul?

Is it

astonishing that

the

philosophers who have isolated this " form ''
of personality should, then, find it insuf­
ficient to characterize a definite person, and
that they should be gradually led to make
their empty ego a kind of bottomless re­
ceptacle, which belongs no more to Peter
than to Paul, and in which there is room,
according to our preference, for entire hu­
manity, for God, or for existence in general?

36

An I ntroduction to

goes beyond each of the successive boun­
daries that we try to assign to it, which

constantly grows larger, and which tends
to lose itself no longer in zero, but in the
infinite.
The distance, then, between a so-called
"empiricism'' like that of Taine and the
most transcendental speculations of certain
German pantheists is very much less than is

g ene r ally supposed.

The method is analo­

gom� in both cases; it consists in reason­

i ng about the elements of a translation as
if they were

parts of the original.

Bu t

a

true empiricism is that which proposes to
get as near to the original itself as pos·
sible, to search deeply into its life, and so,
by a kind of

intellectual auscultation, to

feel the throbbings of its soul; and thh�
true empiricism is the true metaphysics.

It

is true that the task is an extreme ly diffi­
cult one, for none of the ready·made concep­
tions which thought employs in its daily
operations can be of any use.

Xothing is

more easy than to say that the ego is multi·

Metaphysics

37

plicity, or that it is unity, or that it is the
s�·nthesis of both.

Unity and multiplicity

are here representations that we have no
need to cut out on the model of the object;
they are found ready-made, and have only
to be chosen from a heap.

They are stock­

l'lize clothes which do just as well for Peter
as for Paul, for they set off the form of
nPither.

But an empiriciRm worthy of the

name, an empiricism which works only to
measure, is obliged for each new object that
it studies to make an absolutely fresh effort.
It cuts out for the object a concept which
is appropriate to that object alone, a con­
cept which can as yet hardly be called a
concept, Rince it applies to this one thing.
It does not proceed hy combining current
ideas Jike unity and multiplicity; hut it
leads us, on the contrary, to a

simple,

unique representation, which, however once
formed, enableH us to understand easily how
it is that we can place it in the frames

In short, philosophy thus. de·

fined does not consist in the choice of cer·
tain concepts, and in taking sitles with a
school, but in the search for a unique intui·
tion from which we can desceml with equal
ease to different concepts, because we are
placed above the d ivisions of the schools.
/

That personality has unity cannot be de­

nied ; but such an affirmation teaches one
nothing about the extraord inary nature of
the particular unity presented by person­
ality.

That

our self is

multiple

I also

agree, but then it must be understood that

it is a multiplicity which has nothing in
common with any other multiplicity.

Wha t

is really important for philosophy is

to

know exactly what unity, what mul tiplicity,
and what reality superior both to abstraet
unity and multiplicity the multiple unity

of the self actually is.

Now philosophy

will know this only when it recovers pos­
session of the simple intuit ion of the self
by the self.

Then, according t o tlw direc·

tion it chooses for its descent from this
summit, it will arrive at unity or multi-

Metaphysics

39

plicity, or at any one of the concepts by
which we try to define the moving life of
the self.

But no mingling of these con­

cepts would give anything which at all
resembles the self that endures.
If we are shown a solid cone, we see with·
out any difficulty how it narrows towards
the summit and tends to be lost in a mathe·
matical point, and also how it enlarges in
the direction of the base into an indefinitely
increasing circle.

But neither the point

nor the circle, nor the juxtaposition of the
two on a plane, would give us the least
idea of a cone.

The same thing holds true

of the unity and multiplicity of mental life,
and of the zero and the infinite towards

Concepts, as we shall show elsewhere,
generally go together in couples and repre-.
sent two contraries.

There is hardly any

concrete reality which cannot be observed
from two opposing standpoints, which can­
not consequently be subsumed under two

An Introduction to

40

antagonistic concepts.

Hence a thesis and

an antithesis which we endeavor in vain
to reconcile logically, for the very simple
reason that it is impossible, with concepts
and obRervations taken from outside points
of view, to make a t hing.

But from the

object, seized by intuition,_ we pass easily
in many cases to the two contrary conceptR ;
and

as

in that. way thesis and antithesis can

be seen to spring from reality, we grasp at
the same time how it is that the two are
opposed and how they are reconciled.
It is true thut to accomplish this, it is

necessary to pt·oceerl by a rcverRul of the
usual work of the intellect.

ally consists in paRHing from concept!-� to
things, and not from things to concepts.
To know a reality, in the usual sense of the
word " know,'' is to take ready-made con­
cepts, to portion them out and to mix them
together until a practical equivalent of the
reality is obtained.

But it m ust be remem­

bered that the normal work of the intellect
is far from being disinterested.

what known class it belongs, and what kind

suggest to us. These different possible
actions and attitudes are so many concep·
tual directions of our thought, determined
once for all; it remains only to follow
them : in that precisely consists the appli­
cation of concepts to things. To try to fit
a concept on an object is simply to ask
what we can do with the object, and what
it can do for us. To label an object with
a certain concept is to mark in precise terms
the kind of action or attitude the object
should suggest to us. All knowledge, prop­

externally-taken view of the object, is to
go against the end that we have chosen, to
condemn philosophy to an eternal skirmish­
ing between the schools and to install con­
tradiction in the very heart of the object
and of the method.

Either there is no

philosophy possible, and all knowledge of
things is a practical knowledge aimed at
the profit to be drawn from them, or else
philosophy consists in placing oneself with­
iii Hie object itself by an effort of intuition.
But in order to understand the nature of
this intuition, in order to fix with precision
where intuition ends and where analysis
begins, it is necessary to return to what waR
said earlier about the flux of duration.

ing by its continual change of quality the
heavier and still heavier load we drag be­
hind us as we grow older.

Without this

survival of the past into the present there
would be no duration, but only instantaneity.
Probably if I am thus accused of taking
the mental state out of duration by the mere
fact that I analyze it, I shall reply, " Is not
each of these elementary psychical states, to
which my analysis leads, itself a state which
occupies time?

My analysis," I shall say,

" does indeed resolve the inner life into
states, each of which is homogeneous with
itself ; only, since the homogeneity extends
over a definite number of minutes or of
seconds, the elementary psychical state does
not cease to endure, although it does not
change."
But, in saying that, I fail to see that the
definite number of minutes and of seconds,
which I am attributing here to the elemen­
tary psychical state, has simply the value of

a sign intended to remind me that the psy-

Were I to look at it closely, I should

see

that this abstract time is as immobile for
me as the state whic h I localize in it, that
it could flow only by a continual change of

quality, and that if it is without quality,
merely the theatre of t he change, it thus
heromes an immobile medium.

I should see

that the construction of this homogeneous

is simply designed to facilitate the

comparison between the different concrete

There lies the very dis­

the

most we can say is that it passes through
them.

But passage, which is movement, has

nothing in common with stoppage, which
is immobility.

A

movement cannot be

superposed on an immobility, or it would
then coincide with it, which would be a
contradiction.

The points are not in the

movement, as parts, nor even beneath it,
as positions occupied by the moving body.
They are simply projected by us under the
movement, as so many places where a mov­
ing body, which by hypothesis does not
stop, would be if it were to stop.

They are

not, therefore, properly speaking, positions,
but " suppositions," aspects, or points of
view of the mind.

B ut how could we con­

struct a thing with points of view?
Nevertheless, this is what we try to do

An Introduction to

whenever we reason about movement, and
also about time, for which movement serves
as a means of representation.

As a result

of an illusion deeply rooted in our mind,
and because we cannot prevent ourselves
from considering analysis as the equivalent
_of intuition, we begin by distinguishing
along the whole extent of the movement, a
certain number of possible stoppages or
points, which we make, whether they like
it or no, parts of the movement.

Faced

with our impotence to reconstruct the move­
ment with these points, we insert other
points, believing that we can in this way
get nearer to the essential mobility in the
movement.

Then, as this mobility still es·

capes us, we substitute for a

fixed and

finite number of points an " indefinitely in­
creasing " number-thus vainly trying to
counterfeit, by the movement of a thought
that goes on indefinitely adding points to
points, the real and .undivided motion of
the moving body.

Finally, we say that

movement is composed of points, but that

we have done is to seek for the meaning of

tion is much more useful in life than the
intuition of the thing itself would be.

Now

our mind has an irresistible tendency to
consider that idea clearest which is most
often useful to it.

That is why immobility

see ms to it clearer than mobility, and rest
anterior to movement.
The dimculties to which the problem of
movement has given rise fr om the earliest
antiquity have originated in this way.

They

result always from the fact that we insis t
on passing from space to movement, from
the trajectory to the flight, from immobile
positions to mobility, and on passing from
one to the other by way of addition.

But

it is movement which is anterior to im­
mobility, and the relation between positions
and a d isplacement is not that of parts to
a whole, but that of the d iversity of pos­
sible points of view to the real indivisibility
of the object.
Many other problems are born of the
same illusion.

therefore so many stable views of the in­
stability of the real.

And to think of an

object-in the usual meaning of the word
" think "-is to take one or more of these
immobile views of its mobi lity.

It consists,

in short, in asking from time to time where
the object is,

in order that we may know

what to do with it.

Nothing could be more

legitimate, moreover, than this method of
procedure, so long as we are concerned only
with

of

reality.

Knowledge, in so far as it is directed to
practical matters, has only to enumerate
the principal possihle atti tudes of the thing
towards us, as well as our best possible

attitude towards it.

Therein lies the ordi­

nary function of ready-made concepts, thoHe

of becoming.

But to seek to penetrate with

them into the inmost nature of things, is
to apply to the

mobility of the real a

method created in order to give stationary
points of observation on it.

It is to forget

that, if metaphysic is possible, it can only
be a laborious, and even painful, effort to
remount the natural slope of the work of
thought, in order to place oneself directly,
by a kind of intellectual expansion, within
the thing studied : in short, a passage from
reality to concepts and no longer from con­
cepts to reality.

Is it astonishing that, like

children trying to catch smoke by closing
their hands, philosophers so often see the
object they would grasp fly before them ?
It is in this way that many of the quarrels
between the schools are perpetuated, each
of them reproaching the others with having
allowed the real to slip away.

But if, instead of professing to

analyze duration (i. e., at bottom, to make

a AynthesiK of it with concepts ) , we at once
place our��eJves in it by an effort of intu­

Ition, we have the feeling of a certain very

determinate tension, in which the determina-

Metaphysics

tion itl!elf appears as a choice between an
infinity of possible durations.

Hencefor­

ward we can picture to ourselves as many
durations as we wish, all very different
from each other, although each of them, on
being reduced to concepts-that is, observed
externally from two opposing points of view
-always comes in the end to the same in­
definable combination of the many and the
one.
Let us express the same idea with more
precision.

If I consider duration as a

multiplicity of moments bound to each
other by a unity which goes through them
like a thread, then, however short the chosen
duration may be, these moments are un­
limited in number.

I can suppose them as

close together as I please ; there will always
be between these mathematical points other

This is extremely difficult.

direction of the operation by which it habitu­

rather to recast, all its categories.

But in

this way it will attain to fluid concepts,
capable of following reality in all its sinu­

of the inward life of things.

VIII. The reason why this object has
been lost sight of, and why scie nce itself
has been mistaken in the origin of the pro-

cesses it employs, is that intuition, once
attained, must find a mode of expression
and of application which conforms to the
habits of our thought, and one which fur­
nishes us, in the shape of well-defined con­
cepts, with the solid points of support which
we so greatly need.

In that lies the con­

dition of what we call exactitude and pre­
cision,

and

also

the

condition

of

the

unlimited extension of a general method to
particular cases.

Now this extension and

this work of logical improvement can be
continued

for

centuries,

whilst

the

act

:which creates the method lasts but for a
moment.

That is why we so often take the

logical equipment of science for science it­
self/ forgetting the metaphysical intuition

�rom

which all the rest has sprung.

From the overlooking of this intuition
proceeds all that has been said by phi­
losophers and by men of science themselves

always dominated by the belief, so natural

Whence

followed

that action was an enfeebled contemplation,
d uration a deceptive and shifting image of
immobile eternity, the Soul a fall from the

The whole of the philosophy which

begins with Plato and culminates in Ploti­
nus is the development of a principle which

may be formu lated thus :

" There is

more

in the immutable than in the moving, and
we pass from the stable to the unstable by
a mere diminution."

Now it is the contrary

which is true.

what

is happening in

the interval.

But

philosophy can only he a n effort t o tran­
scend the human condition.
Men of science have fixed their attention
mainly on the concepts wit h which they
have marked out the path way of intuition.
The more they laid stress on t hese residual
products, which have t urned into symbols,
the more they attributed a symbolic char­
acter to every kind of science.

And the

more they believed in the symbolic char­
acter of science, the more did they indeed
make science symbolical.

Gradually they

have blotted out all difference, in positive
science, between the natural and the arti­
ficial, between the data of immediate intu­
ition, and the enormous work of analysis

an

causes modern philosophy to place the Soul
above the Idea.

It thus tends, like mod�rn

science, and even more so than modern
science, to advance in an opposite direc­
tion to ancient thought.
But this metaphysics, like this science,
has enfolded its deeper life in a rich tissue
of symbols, forgetting something that, while
science needs symbols for its analytical de­
velopment, the main object of metaphysics
is to do away with symbols.

Here, again,

the understanding has pursued its work of
fixing, dividing, and reconstructing.

It has

In so far as it works

to the

1langer that its whole work may he looked

on to the letter of what metaphysicians and
Hcientists say, and also to the material
aspect of what t hey do, we might believe
that t he metaphysicians have dug a deep
tu nnel beneath rea lity, that the scientista
have thrown an elegant bridge over it, but
that the moving stream of

th i n gs passes

between these two artificial constructions
without touching them.
One of the principal artifices of the
Kantian criticism consisted in taking the
metaphysician and the scientist literally,

forcing both metaphysics and science t o the
extreme limit of symbolism to which they
could go, and to which, moreover, they make
their way of their own accord as soon as

Having once overlooked the

ties that bind science and metaphysics to

Since he has exaggerated the ind¢'·

organizes nature, and

finds itself again

therein as in a mirror.

Hence the possi·

bility of science, which owes all its efficacy
to its relativity, and the impossibility of
metaphysics, since the latter finds nothing
more to do than to parody with phantoms of
things the work of conceptual arrangement
which science practises seriously on rela­
tions.

Briefly,

the whole Critique of Pure

Reason ends in establishing that Platonism,
illegitimate if Ideas are things, becomes le­
gitimate if Ideas are relations, and that the
ready-made idea, once brought down in thi11
way from heaven to earth, is in fact, as Plato

held, the common basis alike of thought and
of nature. But the whole of the Critique of
Pure Reason also rests on this postulate,
that our in.tellect is incapable of anything
but Platonizing-that is, of pouring all pos­
sible experience into pre-existing moulds.
On this the whole question depends.

made of them ; they owe most of their clear·
ness to the light which the facts, and the
applications to which they led, have by
reflection shed on them-the clearness of a
concept being scarcely anything more at
bottom than the certainty, at last obtained,
of manipulating the concept profitably.

At

its origin, more than one of these concepts
must

have appeared obscure,

not easily

reconcilable with the concepts already ad·
mitted into science, and indeed very near
the border-line of absurdity.

This means

that science does not proceed by an orderly
dovetailing together of concepts predestined
to fit each other exactly.

True and fruitful

ideas are 80 many close contacts with cur·
rents of reality, which d� not necessarily
converge on the same point.

However, the

concepts in which they lodge themselves
manage somehow, by rubbing oft' each other' It
