## What is Analytic Style?

This repository contains files for my stylometric analysis of a subcorpora of the analytic philosophy canon, a textual tradition beginning with the work of Gotlob Frege (1848-1925), Betrand Russell (1872-1970), G.E. Moore (1873-1958), and Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889-1951), and ending with the works of English language philosophers in the late 1950's early 1960's.  

The tradition began with an act of revolution on the part of Russel and Moore against the British Idealist philosophy of T.H. Green (1836-1882), F. H. Bradley (1846-1924), Bernard Bosanquet (1848-1923), and as Russell sees it, "Against both Kant and Hegel." What made the new philosopht of Russell and Moore was a commitment to a particular metaphilosophical belief, that "all sound philosophy should begin with an *analysis of propositions*," which meant something slightly different to both Russell and Moore. The method of philosophy eventually formulated so as to capture both men's projects, was one in which philosophy is seen as having as its central task the offering of explanations and clarifications about the nature of various parts of language, by way of various other linguistic devices, with the languages of formal logic playing a central and uniquely important role in the explanatory process. This is drastically different from what was taken to be the uniting central task of traditional philosophy up to that point, that being the formulation of a *logos* of the world, a rationally coherent account of reality at the level of utmost generality; of reality as a totality. Thus, coming to be concerned with explaining facts about language and not "capital R Reality", the turn to analytic philosophy is sometimes refered to as the *Lingustic Turn*.

In time this approach to philosophy became the unquestionable dominant metaphilosophical position of English speaking philosophy departments the world over, a position it enjoyed without devitation until the 1960's, when multiple camps within the movement began to disagree with one another over deep and central issues related to the nature of language, over scientific knowledge and practice, and the analytic methods themselves, and hence the nature of philosophy. Today, almost noone working in a English speaking philosophy department and publishing in English philosophy journals would consider themselves adherents to the positions of Russell, or Moore, or Wittgenstein, and with the defining feature of this present era sometimes being identified with its ecclectisism and philosophical pluralism, there is a sense in which we are in a "post-analytic" stage.

There are two issues with describing English philosophy as post-analytic though. The first is that it is not a label used by most philosophers, journals, and philosophical associations to describe themselves or what it is that they do. [There are more assocations of analytic philosophy today then there have ever been before](http://www.dif.unige.it/esap), and it is practiced more and more in non-english philosophical communities. Clearly then, we have not moved past being analytic in the sense that we still prefer to call ourselves analytic. The second issue is more interesting and formed part one part of the motivation for this project. It is clear also that if we mean for post-analytic to denote a particular "ism", in manner similar to something like post-Helianism would, then there is no "ism" associated with post-analytic philosophy. Philosophers calling themselves analytic hold a wide variety of competing beliefs about central philosophical issues, and whats more, they are not particularly good at guessing what the most popular positions taken by their peers are,as was shown by David Bourget and David Chalmers in their [Philpapers survey and metasurvey](https://philpapers.org/surveys/). Again it seems clear that there just is no one thing to be called post-analytic philosophy or analytic philosophy understood as a particular doctrine or set of beliefs today. 

So why do they call themselves analytic, and what do they mean? Of the kinds of answers typically given, two are the ones this project was concieved of as scrutinizing: what I will call the **the stylistic answer**, is the that analytic philosophy today is any philosophy written in a particular style, called the **analytic style**. 

Under a naive conception of analytic style, it is supposed to be characterized by the unique level of emphasis it places on **argumentation, clarity, and rigour**, in comparison to "non-analytic" philosophy. But history tells us that none of these three features are distinctive of analytic philosophy. Argumentation has always been emphasized in philosophy; Wittgenstein, unquestionably one of the most influential authors in the analytic tradition, was called a mystic by Carnap, his works requiring a great deal of interpretation and to this day reasonable disagreements are had about what he really meant in works like the *Philosophical investigations*; Husserl argued that philosophy is a "rigorous science", where his phenomenological definition of rigour is as similar to any one analytic definition as any two of them are to each other.

Never the less, even among those philosophers who recognize all the points just made, their belief in a distinctive analytic style does not waiver, even though now they may find it difficult or even impossible to say exactly what such a style consists of! However, the above mentioned *positive* characterization of analytic style has a *negative* characterization with which it correlates; whatever analytic style is, it is often believed that it is certain that there is one thing it is *not*, and that is what derisively gets called **Continental philosophy**.


#What is Continental Style?
If Analytic Philosophy broke with the traditional philosophy in taking its linguistic turn, we might say roughly that Continental Philosophy comprises all that philosophy that *did not* take such a turn, at least the same kind or at the same time that analytic philosophy did.
